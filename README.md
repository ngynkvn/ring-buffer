# ringbuffer

This is just a direct rip of [RingBuffer](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/e27b4647d86e3bdaf2c4fd95db2e7d359afd7fc4/lib/std/RingBuffer.zig#L16) but with a generic type parameter so I can use it for floats

*I would not use this*, RingBuffer is small enough you can / should just copy the code instead of pulling this as a dependency.
